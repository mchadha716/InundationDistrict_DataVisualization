            The oceans are rising: greenhouse gases, melting glaciers, and thermal expansion have
            and will continue to devastate infrastructure and coastal habitats. As climate change
            stands now, these sea levels will "wreak havoc on coastal cities across the world." 
            One city in particular that will face these changes is Boston. Though it already
            experiences regular flooding, it is predicted to face up to 1.5 feet of sea-level rise
            by 2050. Such a rise in sea levels will primarily affect buildings in the Seaport
            district. The data visualizations below display how flooding is increasing, how sea
            levels are rising, and how vulnerable buildings are to such concerns. We hope that this
            project will increase the Boston community's awareness of the problem, as well as
            motivate further research on the effect of rising sea levels in Boston.

        <p>
          Heavy precipitation has become increasingly more common since the 1950s in most areas of the world, the United States included. As the planet continues to warm, it is expected that these 
          trends will continue to rise: warmer air can hold more water vapor, and for each degree of warming, the capacity for water vapor in the air increases by nearly 7 percent. The Midwest and 
          Northeast regions of the United States, in particular, have seen the strongest increase in heavy precipitation events.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The most immediate threat from this increase in heavy precipitation comes from flooding. In urban areas such as Boston, floods have the ability to devastate roads and infrastructure, 
          harm human health, and overwhelm sewer systems.

            <p>
              The largest indicator of changes to precipitation rates in the recent past is the frequency 
              of extreme weather events such as prolonged droughts and flash flooding. From the mid-1960s 
              until the mid 1980s, the average number of inches of precipitation per year in the Northeast 
              region of the United States remained relatively steady at around 31 average inches of 
              precipitation per year. However, this number rose dramatically in the years between 1987 and 
              1996 by nearly four inches. Given that the Northeast is home to many coastal cities and 
              towns, such an increase is of large concern.

          <div id='prec-slide-2' class='hidden'>
            <h3 class='storyboard-h3'>1997-2016</h3>
            <p>
              In the twenty years from the mid 1990s until the mid 2010s, the average number of inches of 
              precipitation per year in the Northeast skyrocketed to around 42 inches. Indeed, there has 
              been a 53% increase in extreme precipitation events since 1996, according to a study 
              published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. The result has proven to be 
              “heavy rain and snow resulting in about 1 to 2 inches of water a day depending on location 
              since 1996.” This also coincides with warming sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              According to a study published in Weather and Climate Extremes, these cases of extreme 
              precipitation have been proven to be the result of greenhouse gasses, both from human activity and 
              from the variability of the Atlantic Ocean’s surface temperature. Jonathan Winter, a co-author 
              of the aforementioned study and a principal member of the Applied Hydroclimatology Group at 
              Dartmouth, concludes that “humans are in fact, partially responsible for the increase in heavy 
              rain events that we have been experiencing over the past two and a half decades.”

        <p>
          Floods are among the most common natural disasters in the United States. They devastate 
          lives, natural habitats and city infrastructure alike, and they are on a continuously 
          upward trend. Global warming continues to exacerbate rises in sea level, and has been 
          noted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to “detectably influence” many 
          variables that play a part in flooding. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Projections currently show that cities along coastlines could experience over ten feet of 
          sea level rise within a century. The vast loss of lives and property damage that such 
          flooding has the potential to cause is indisputable. Indeed, Boston’s Seaport district 
          is particularly vulnerable to such concerns.

            <p>The seventy years between 1920 and 1990 showed a steady increase in the national
              average number of high-tide flooding days. Boston in particular experienced a larger
              increase in such flood days, with its peak occurring during the 1970s, at 35 days 
              compared to the national average of 8.4 days. Such an increase was certainly an early 
              indication of the drastically negative effects that climate change poses to a coastal 
              city.

            <p>
              In the twenty years between 1990 and 2010, the number of high tide flood days has skyrocketed. 
              Although both the national average number of high-tide flood days and the number of high-tide 
              flood days in Boston both rose drastically, the number of such days in Boston is far higher. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              As sea levels rise, coastal cities like Boston will likely face the worst of such flooding. 
              Increased storm surge flooding, combined with drainage systems that are not equipped to handle such 
              sea levels, make this a pressing issue that much of Boston’s infrastructure is not prepared to face.

            <p>
              The future of high-tide flooding in Boston is predicted to increase to around 70 high-tide flood days 
              per year by 2050, compared to the 11 days of high-tide flooding this past year and the 22 days of high-tide 
              flooding in 2017. This drastic rise “endangers crucial infrastructure in Boston, including waste and 
              stormwater systems, MBTA lines, and roads.” Predictions such as these are based on the “range of relative sea 
              level rise,” using intermediate scenarios from the National Climate Assessment.

        <p>
          An interagency study conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that even by intermediate 
          estimates, sea levels in Boston will rise by over a foot by 2050. By 2150, this number rises to nearly 90 inches of 
          sea-level rise. High estimates prove to be far more drastic, increasing to nearly 150 inches of sea-level rise by 2150. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Boston already experiences much of the worst high-tide flooding in the nation, and by these estimates large portions of 
          Boston, including Seaport, would be swallowed up by the sea.

    <h1>Project G01: Rising Sea Levels, DS 4200 S22</h1>

    <p><strong>Mira Chadha</strong>, <strong>Michelle Lo</strong>, <strong>Annetta Stogniew</strong></p>

    <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of
      <a href='https://neu-ds-4200-s22.github.io/'>Ds 4200 S22 Information Presentation & Visualization</a>,
      taught by <a href='https://cody.khoury.northeastern.edu/'>Prof. Cody Dunne</a>,

    </p>


    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>
      This project will consist of data visualizations about rising sea levels. The graphics will 
      show how flooding is increasing, how sea levels are rising, and how vulnerable various 
      buildings will be to sea levels over time. This project is beneficial to understanding more 
      about climate change and how it can affect coastal cities such as Boston. The resulting data 
      will be used in an upcoming documentary film about how rising sea levels will affect Boston, 
      particularly its Seaport neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising sea levels are being caused by rapidly melting ice caps and rising global average 
      temperatures. As climate change stands now, these sea levels will “wreak havoc on coastal 
      cities across the world.” Some cities listed by a United Nations report include Mumbai, New 
      York, Shanghai, and Miami. Boston, a city that already experiences regular flooding, is 
      predicted to face up to 1.5 feet of sea-level rise by 2050. This would primarily affect 
      buildings in the Seaport district. Data visualizations that show how flooding is increasing, 
      how sea levels are rising, and how vulnerable buildings will be to rising sea levels will 
      increase the Boston community’s awareness of the problem as well as motivate further research 
      on the effect of rising sea levels in Boston. These data visualizations are planned to appear 
      in an upcoming documentary film.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got approval from Cody to exclude interactivity from our visualizations, substituted by 
      extra storytelling elements. Therefore, rather than the typical site set up, we have included 
      a storyboard below that exhibits what our final site will look like. Right now, it is about
      half-finished. Some visualizations have not yet been coded, so they've been replaced by
      the sketches we created for them in a previous part. Only one of the paths for exploration
      work below, so the 'Precipitation' and 'Flooding' buttons currently have no function. The 
      'Next' button properly transitions the visualizations, but does not yet change the text above.
      These changes will all be present in the final site.
    </p>
