          Since the 1950s, heavy precipitation has become more common around the world. 
          As the planet continues to warm, this trend will continue, because warmer air can hold more water vapor.
          In the United States, the Midwest and Northeast have experienced the largest increase in 
          frequency of heavy precipitation events.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The most immediate threat of heavy precipitation is flooding. 
          In urban areas such as Boston, floods have the ability to devastate roads and infrastructure, 
          harm human health, and overwhelm sewer systems.

              Extreme weather events such as prolonged droughts and flash flooding have been the primary
              indicators of changes to precipitation rates in recent years. From the mid-1960s 
              to the mid-1980s, the average inches of precipitation per year in the Northeast
              remained steady. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              This number rose in the years between 1987 and 1996, likely due to extreme weather events at the time.

            <p class='vis-text'>
              From 1997 to 2006, the average inches of precipitation per year increased even more dramatically 
              than in the previous decade; then plateaued from 2007 to 2016. The result has been 
              “heavy rain and snow resulting in about 1 to 2 inches of water a day depending on location 
              since 1996.” 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              A study published in Weather and Climate Extremes explained that these instances of extreme 
              precipitation result from an increase of greenhouse gasses caused by human activity and 
              variable surface temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean.

            Floods are among the most common natural disasters in the United States. They can cause
            loss of human life, destruction of property and an increase in waterborne diseases. As 
            global warming continues to exacerbate rises in sea level, it “detectably influences” 
            many variables that cause flooding, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Projections show that cities along coastlines could experience over 10 feet of 
            sea-level rise within the next 100 years. Boston has historically surpassed national averages
            in annual flooding. Studies show this trend is likely to continue.

              Early data shows Boston's location on the water may have boosted its susptability to flooding.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              From 1920 to 1990, the number of high-tide flood days, days on which tides inundated
              low-lying areas, increased steadily across the nation.
              But Boston consistently recorded more high-tide flood days per decade than the national average.

            <p class="vis-text">
              In just two decades  between 1990 and 2010, the number of high-tide flood days skyrocketed
              throughout the United States. But again, Boston faced an especially drastic spike in high-tide flooding.
              The number of flood days in Boston tripled from 1990 to 2010, while the national average doubled.
            <br/>
            <br/>
              Much of Boston’s infrastructure will not be prepared to face continuous increases in annual flood days. 
              Dated drainage systems that are common in one the United States' oldest cities are not equipped to handle 
              repeated floods.

              By 2050, Boston is predicted to experience 70 high-tide flood days per year, which would amount to
              more than four times as many high-tide flood days per decade compared to 2010.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Such a drastic rise in flooding “endangers crucial infrastructure in Boston, including waste and

          The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, has found that even by intermediate 
          estimates, sea levels in Boston will rise by over a foot by 2050. High estimates are more severe 
          and predict 21.3 inches of sea-level rise by 2050. These projections only become
          more drastic with time. Both of these estimates are far above the city code for development, which defines
          what degree of potential flood risk is safe for infrastructure development.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Boston endures worse high-tide flooding than most cities in the United States. By NOAA's estimates,
          large portions of Boston, including Seaport, will be swallowed up by the sea in the coming century. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          We hope that this project will increase the Boston community's awareness of the problem, as well as
          motivate further research on the effect of rising sea levels in Boston.

    <h1>Project G01: Rising Sea Levels, DS 4200 S22</h1>

    <p><strong>Mira Chadha</strong>, <strong>Michelle Lo</strong>, <strong>Annetta Stogniew</strong></p>

    <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of
      <a href='https://neu-ds-4200-s22.github.io/'>Ds 4200 S22 Information Presentation & Visualization</a>,
      taught by <a href='https://cody.khoury.northeastern.edu/'>Prof. Cody Dunne</a>,

    </p>


    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>
      This project will consist of data visualizations about rising sea levels. The graphics will 
      show how flooding is increasing, how sea levels are rising, and how vulnerable various 
      buildings will be to sea levels over time. This project is beneficial to understanding more 
      about climate change and how it can affect coastal cities such as Boston. The resulting data 
      will be used in an upcoming documentary film about how rising sea levels will affect Boston, 
      particularly its Seaport neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising sea levels are being caused by rapidly melting ice caps and rising global average 
      temperatures. As climate change stands now, these sea levels will “wreak havoc on coastal 
      cities across the world.” Some cities listed by a United Nations report include Mumbai, New 
      York, Shanghai, and Miami. Boston, a city that already experiences regular flooding, is 
      predicted to face up to 1.5 feet of sea-level rise by 2050. This would primarily affect 
      buildings in the Seaport district. Data visualizations that show how flooding is increasing, 
      how sea levels are rising, and how vulnerable buildings will be to rising sea levels will 
      increase the Boston community’s awareness of the problem as well as motivate further research 
      on the effect of rising sea levels in Boston. These data visualizations are planned to appear 
      in an upcoming documentary film.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got approval from Cody to exclude interactivity from our visualizations, substituted by 
      extra storytelling elements. Therefore, rather than the typical site set up, we have included 
      a storyboard below that exhibits what our final site will look like. Right now, it is about
      half-finished. Some visualizations have not yet been coded, so they've been replaced by
      the sketches we created for them in a previous part. Only one of the paths for exploration
      work below, so the 'Precipitation' and 'Flooding' buttons currently have no function. The 
      'Next' button properly transitions the visualizations, but does not yet change the text above.
      These changes will all be present in the final site.
    </p>
