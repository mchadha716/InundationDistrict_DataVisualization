    <h1>Project G01: Rising Sea Levels, DS 4200 S22</h1>

    <p><strong>Mira Chadha</strong>, <strong>Michelle Lo</strong>, <strong>Annetta Stogniew</strong></p>

    <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of
      <a href='https://neu-ds-4200-s22.github.io/'>Ds 4200 S22 Information Presentation & Visualization</a>,
      taught by <a href='https://cody.khoury.northeastern.edu/'>Prof. Cody Dunne</a>,

    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>
      This project will consist of data visualizations about rising sea levels. The graphics will 
      show how flooding is increasing, how sea levels are rising, and how vulnerable various 
      buildings will be to sea levels over time. This project is beneficial to understanding more 
      about climate change and how it can affect coastal cities such as Boston. The resulting data 
      will be used in an upcoming documentary film about how rising sea levels will affect Boston, 
      particularly its Seaport neighborhood.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rising sea levels are being caused by rapidly melting ice caps and rising global average 
      temperatures. As climate change stands now, these sea levels will “wreak havoc on coastal 
      cities across the world.” Some cities listed by a United Nations report include Mumbai, New 
      York, Shanghai, and Miami. Boston, a city that already experiences regular flooding, is 
      predicted to face up to 1.5 feet of sea-level rise by 2050. This would primarily affect 
      buildings in the Seaport district. Data visualizations that show how flooding is increasing, 
      how sea levels are rising, and how vulnerable buildings will be to rising sea levels will 
      increase the Boston community’s awareness of the problem as well as motivate further research 
      on the effect of rising sea levels in Boston. These data visualizations are planned to appear 
      in an upcoming documentary film.
    </p>

    <p>
      We got approval from Cody to exclude interactivity from our visualizations, substituted by 
      extra storytelling elements. Therefore, rather than the typical site set up, we have included 
      a storyboard below that exhibits what our final site will look like. Right now, it is about
      half-finished. Some visualizations have not yet been coded, so they've been replaced by
      the sketches we created for them in a previous part. Only one of the paths for exploration
      work below, so the 'Precipitation' and 'Flooding' buttons currently have no function. The 
      'Next' button properly transitions the visualizations, but does not yet change the text above.
      These changes will all be present in the final site.
    </p>

          <p>The oceans are rising: greenhouse gases, melting glaciers, and thermal expansion have
            and will continue to devastate infrastructure and coastal habitats. As climate change
            stands now, these sea levels will "wreak havoc on coastal cities across the world." 
            One city in particular that will face these changes is Boston. Though it already
            experiences regular flooding, it is predicted to face up to 1.5 feet of sea-level rise
            by 2050. Such a rise in sea levels will primarily affect buildings in the Seaport
            district. The data visualizations below display how flooding is increasing, how sea
            levels are rising, and how vulnerable buildings are to such concerns. We hope that this
            project will increases the Boston community's awareness of the problem, as well as
            motivate further research on the effect of rising sea levels in Boston.

        <h2 class='storyboard-h2'>Flooding</h2>
        <p>Floods are among the most common natural disasters in the United States. They devastate 
          lives, natural habitats and city infrastructure alike, and they are on a continuously 
          upward trend. Global warming continues to exacerbate rises in sea level, and has been 
          noted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to “detectably influence” many 
          variables that play a part in flooding. 
          </p>

          <p>
          Projections currently show that cities along coastlines could experience over ten feet of 
          sea level rise within a century. The vast loss of lives and property damage that such 
          flooding has the potential to cause is indisputable. Indeed, Boston’s Seaport district 
          is particularly vulnerable to such concerns.

          <p>The seventy years between 1920 and 1990 showed a steady increase in the national
            average number of high-tide flooding days. Boston in particular experienced a larger
            increase in such flood days, with its peak occurring during the 1970s, at 35 days 
            compared to the national average of 8.4 days. Such an increase was certainly an early 
            indication of the drastically negative effects that climate change poses to a coastal 
            city.
